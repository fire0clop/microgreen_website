This is a copy of my first project on django python (the main project is currently moderated on pythonanywhere, but I try to actively update the version on github as well). 
Besides the project itself my goal is also to practice my skills in python programming using database and django, as well as skills in html, css, js

The purpose of this project is the realization of the site -internet store with embedded management over customer orders. Internet store is only for the clients of the company. 
This online store is incomplete (it does not and will not have a system of online payment, calculation of delivery as the client makes an order directly from the company at whose expense and delivery is carried out) In fact, it is a storefront with the ability to create an order, with a realized personal user account. 
However, this is not the final form of the project. In the future it will be connected to a complex company management structure.
The online store will be just a link connecting the company and the client. In this store the user buys goods, then the information about the order and volumes goes to another application that calculates logistics (i.e. when and to whom the order is delivered, calculates payment, creates analytics on the consumer.)
Using this information, production volumes for the following periods will be calculated in the future, that is, what and how many goods need to be produced. Calculates the effectiveness of the sale of each product. 
Accounting will also be connected there, namely work with 1C and much more. 
In essence, this store is one of the links that the company will completely control.
When I finish at least a small part of the skeleton, I will post this project too.
